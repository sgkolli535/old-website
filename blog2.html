		<h1>A Good Hindu</h1>
		<p>My father always said,</p>
		<p>"A good Hindu goes to the temple"</p>
		<p>My mother always nodded her head</p>
		<p>As she often did in my father's presence</p>
		<p>My brother always scoffed at his words</p>
		<p>Which our family came to ignore</p>
		<p>But I always listened with diligence</p>

		<p>Over the years some questions arose</p>
		<p>Regarding the definition of a good Hindu</p>
		<p>Of the importance of the temple</p>
		<p>And the example of a real devotee</p>

		<p>Does a good Hindu go to the temple</p>
		<p>To see her father put only 50 rupees in the hundi*</p>
		<p>Which the neighbors and even the priests jeer at</p>
		<p>That later leads him to hang himself out of shame</p>

		<p>Does a good Hindu chant hymns at the temple</p>
		<p>To see her mother mocked as a widow</p>
		<p>By the "pious" women in the sanctuary</p>
		<p>That provoked her depression and early death</p>

		<p>Does a good Hindu pray at the temple</p>
		<p>To see her brother beaten to death on the marble steps</p>
		<p>For borrowing 100 rupees to feed his sister</p>
		<p>That he repaid a single day late</p>

		<p>I have yet to set foot in a temple after my childhood</p>
		<p>Some say I am not devout enough</p>
		<p>They shun me for my lack of faith</p>
		<p>But my choices are within reason</p>

		<p>Many do not seem to understand</p>
		<p>That devotion is not stealing prasad*</p>
		<p>Or throwing wads of cash for donation</p>
		<p>Or buying hoards of prayer books</p>

		<p>Devotion is my father</p>
		<p>When he labored in the mines to buy my school shoes</p>
		<p>Devotion is my mother</p>
		<p>When she sold her ring for my textbooks</p>
		<p>Devotion is my brother</p>
		<p>When he started working at 15 years old for my lunches</p>

		<p>Everything my family did to raise me</p>
		<p>Revealed the true meaning of devotion</p>
		<p>Every one of them was a good Hindu</p>
		<p>As God does not reside in the temple</p>
		<p>He is within the hearts of the true devotees</p>

		<p>*hundi- a location in temples in which donations towards the temple are deposited</p>
		<p>*prasad- a small offering of food during a religious ritual that is later given to the attendees</p>
