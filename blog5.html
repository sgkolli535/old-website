		<h1>Compounding</h1>
		<p>In my time, I have attended a few seminars, lectures, information sessions, and more regarding the art of personal finance. Most of the time, these sessions have great variance in terms of the order and of information that is presented, but there is one undeniable commonality between every event: a lesson on compounding interest.</p>
		<p>I was first introduced to compounding interest in my sixth grade Advanced Mathematics class. We were learning about exponential equations, and Compounding Interest was one of the main real-world applications we were taught. Mathematically, Compound interest is defined by the formula: A = P(1+(r/n))^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate, n is the amount of times the money is compounded, and t is the length of time for which the compound interest is applied. I never thought much of this formula until more recently, as I have been navigating the terrain of personal finance. Compound interest is one of those forces that is able to be understood in the short-term, but becomes difficult to visualize in the long term. In terms of finance, compound interest serves as an example of the power of compounding money by investing. If one were to simply leave their savings in a checking/savings account, their money would be kept safe and earn a small simple interest rate. Or conversely, there would be minimal growth. By diversifying one's portfolio, they are able to watch their money multiply to leaps and bounds of what the principal amount is.</p>
		<p>We are unable to truly understand the potency of compounding in the long-term, which is why people may tend to shy away from the possibility of risks that accompany investing in everything from stocks, bonds, real estate, and more. What is important to understand is that short term risks are present, but in the long term, the idea of compounding will begin to take place and diminish any short-term losses that may have taken place.</p>
		<p>I recently read an article on Shane Parrish's Farnam Street Blog titled "Gate's Law: How Progress Compounds and Why it Matters". The reading was an eye-opener for me, as the concept of Compounding was applied to progress, something I viewed as an abstract concept that could not be defined in such terms. Parrish dwells mostly on the impacts of technological progress, citing Stanford Computer Scientist Roy Amara: "we overestimate technology in the short-term and underestimate the effect in the long run." He compares the effect of exponential growth to the growth of technology, from the invention of desktops to the widespread usage of the internet and smart phones. We tend to see short-term possibilities for more than what they are, tend to not understand the breadth of possibilities in the long-term. This can once again be applied to investing principles. In the short-term, we may see a market drop as disillusioning and riskier than what it is. Realistically, this temporary market decline will level off in the future and the rewards of the investments will be far greater than anticipated. The key is to not be wary of short-term risks and realize the bigger rewards that will take place in the long-term. Parrish ends his article by stating that exponential growth is known to eventually plateau, during which alternate routes to progress must be taken to continue development. A similar ideal can be taken with investing, where diminishing returns can be seen as an indication to modify the proportions of the portfolio for each asset class.</p>
		<p>Generally, the power of exponential growth and compounding interest can be applied to many ideas, including progress, financial returns, and even lifestyle changes. Small changes in habits in the short-term can reap great rewards in the long-term. Though it might be a difficult concept to apply to all areas, compounding is an innate ideology that will do well to be understood.</p>
