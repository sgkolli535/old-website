		<h1>Surface Level</h1>
		<p>Depth. Without depth, there would be no dimension, contrast, or meaning in our world. For example, the ocean can reach up to 11,000 meters deep, but all that is visible to the naked eye are expanses of blue waves tumbling across the surface. There are no stories of people scuba-diving in the Marianas Trench, because most simply stay within the boundaries of commercial beaches and lagoons. The surface provides us with safety and the comfort of the known, without the need to commit. Society is riddled with those not willing to take leaps of faith to explore the uncharted territories or venture past the discovered, but the universe only rewards the adventurers, the pioneers, and the explorers. No reward is worth having without a sufficient amount of sacrifice to define it. In more recent generations, more and more people are afraid of commitment and being held down in time and effort, but we need to realize that a certain amount of commitment is needed to actually accomplish something.</p>
		<p>Throughout high school, students are required to take mandatory classes, those deemed to be of the utmost importance to their knowledge base in their life after graduation. Such classes can include biology, government, chemistry, calculus, and many more. Of course, certain concepts are necessary to general knowledge in everyday life, making these core classes more valuable, but there is one fundamental conceptual mistake many people make. A notion that emerges in these high school classes is that they are an indication of the subject as a whole, but this is dangerously inaccurate. Just because one takes AP Government in high school, he/she is not entitled to become a successful politician. Conversely, a bad grade in high school calculus does not automatically rule out a career in engineering. There are so many factors that make-up academics in high school, so people confuse causation and correlation between classes and careers. Interest in success in a class could be a sign to pursue a career path, but it is not the only way. What these classes have in common is that they are all surface level. They explore mainly the basic levels of each topic, without much depth.</p>
		<p>Misconceptions are created when one glosses over a subject and makes a snap judgement. In other words, they make a decision based only on the surface level. No evidence, information, or background is used to create these opinions. For investing, people see the great risks, the drastic rewards, or even the possible unpredictability. This is what drives people from making the leap to invest; the most visible areas are the failures of others: the dramatic monetary losses and bankruptcies. These cases are rare and cannot be considered representative of investing as a whole. In reality, people make money in the stock market with highly methodical approaches. There is nothing unpredictable or dangerous. Such assumptions are made from a lack of knowledge and ignorance. Investing plans unique to each investor, but the most important part is that there is a method to the madness. These choices cannot be made simply on "liking a company" or "hearing that a company is doing well." Calculations, predictions, and evaluations are what define an investor from a spender, an amateur from a professional. Surface level decisions are what make the stock market unforgiving, as the real analysts are separated from the uninformed buyer in this way. With commitments of time and effort, the depth of knowledge is deepened, allowing for significant success in an area thought to be completely randomized. Depth is for the brave souls, those willing to give themselves completely to a cause, while expanse is for the weak, those too afraid of commitment, leading to spreading themselves across a wide area. As Sammy Davis Jr. concisely stated, "You always have two choices: your commitment versus your fear."</p>
