		<h1>Student2</h1>
		<p>Stress, anxiety, and desperation plagued the young populace</p>
		<p>What used to be a safe haven for learning and expression,</p>
		<p>Had transformed into a vicious breeding ground for rivalries</p>
		<p>No longer present was the light-hearted banter among comrades</p>
		<p>Only the constant struggle to come out on top remained</p>
		<p>Jealousy and greed circulated the hallways like blood coursing through the veins</p>
		<p>With any evidence of passion erased from the minds of the individuals,</p>
		<p>They were forced to solely fixate on the rankings, reports, and results pressed upon them</p>
		<p>The seven hours each day served as a scavenging ground for any trace of recognition</p>
		<p>"Competitive" was not sufficient to describe the atmosphere</p>
		<p>Crueler than the savage food chains of the wilderness,</p>
		<p>A single blunder made one the prey of constant glares and gossips</p>
		<p>There was an endless pursuit to catch any poor soul stumble in their steps</p>
		<p>Vigilance and aggression proved to be the only option for survival</p>
		<p>Not one being was spared the burden of the systemâ€™s anarchy</p>
		<p>Passerby could not notice the devastation within the heavy brick walls</p>
		<p>All that was visible to the outside was a sizeable banner that read:</p>
		<p>"Welcome to High School"</p>
