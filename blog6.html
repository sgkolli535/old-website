		<h1>Emotions are a Lot</h1>
		<p>One of the greatest capacities of the human species is to experience emotion. What differentiates people from other animals is the ability to have such a great depth and complexity of emotions. Emotions, of course, can be a blessing for us to express ourselves in so many different ways, but the commonplace of emotions in our choices also poses an issue for logic and common sense to shine through. Being a constant given in the human mind, people are constantly striving to find a balance in what they feel. Emotional needs are a reality and are a consistent force behind most of the decisions a person makes on a regular basis, whether they are welcome or not.</p>
		<p>Because humans are inherently emotional creatures, it is not possible for us to have complete control of our feelings, but some people are more capable of this than others. I've been told in the past that I'm somewhat emotionless, or "blank", in what I express outwards, and I actually agree with this. I don't see myself as a person that is able to vividly show an emotion, like happiness or sadness. I find myself smiling quite rarely, if at all, in a given day. On the other hand, it's also been months since the last time I remember myself shedding a tear. My mother always tells me that, because I usually have a distant look on my face, I might not be as approachable as someone that greets you with a huge grin. In this way, showing emotions helps with providing a physical front of reliability and may garner more relationships. The most intimate relationships are among those who are able to give themselves up as an open book. Emotions are necessary in interacting with certain people around you, but there are scenarios in which achieving a control of them is needed the most.</p>
		<p>Due to the vulnerability of human nature, most people find themselves in a regular battle to separate their emotions from the decision-making process. To coin Aristotle's three rhetorics for persuasion, "ethos, pathos, and logos" are consecutively the appeal to credibility, emotions, and logic. The majority of people find themselves consumer by pathos, leaving logos massively overshadowed. In specific areas, though, overexposed emotions pose a real threat. Investing is seen as a dangerous and risky world, but this is a huge misconception. The only time investing is risky is if we, as the investor, make it out to be like that. People almost always base their financial decisions on feelings that are evoked, for example, from buying shares of a certain company. Let's say that you love Disney movies and have been to both Disney World and Disney Land, so you decide you'll buy their stock. Just because you feel a certain way about the products or services of a company does not rationalize investing in them. This is equivalent to the cliche, but accurate, statement, "Don't judge a book by its cover." There is so much more to look into a company before investing in its stock, such as the intrinsic value, the Return on Equity, the Margin of Safety, the Price to Earnings Ratio, and so many more. Given all of the hard data there is to value a stock and make a decision, why is it that people rarely commit to this? The best decisions in investing are made after actually studying the numbers of a share. If you do this, the world of investing will shift from being risky to being rewarding. And to the question I posed before, there's really no explanation. People are wired to be irrational at times, but not everyone has to stay like that.</p>
