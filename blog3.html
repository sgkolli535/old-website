		<h1>Leave Your Comfort Zone</h1>
		<p>Comfort has an important part in all of our daily lives. We often associate comfort with curling up under a cozy blanket, or digging into a steaming bowl of soup. There are certain connections that arise when the term comfort is mentioned, such as safe, forgiving, or constant. The world can be cruel, so basic human nature lends us to gravitate towards comfort. From the time of the first humans, our main instinct has been survival, which ultimately means fleeing dangers and basking in safety to live to see another day. If everyday is spent with such constant vigilance to look out for danger, we lose the ability to live and go through experiences that give our life meaning and thrill. Thus, comfort may not be the hero we need after all.</p>
		<p>I have always seen myself as somewhat of a safe girl. Venturing out of my comfort zone at age 5 would be swinging higher than a few feet or climbing the monkey bars. Now at age 17, a risk would be going to a big party Friday night, or waiting to do a homework assignment the period before its due. I haven't lived out the typical "high school experience", whether its going through your first relationship, and eventual break-up, or having late-night rendezvous to the local Target with my friends. In this sense, I haven't left my comfort zone. I prefer to see a small group of friends, rather than hanging out with huge groups, and a quiet night in watching a movie always seems better than a raging party. In this sense, I have not stepped out of my comfort zone, but this is because I know where my boundaries are and what gives me satisfaction. I do take risks in terms of my ambition, like what I want to pursue and how I plan on getting there. Throughout high school I've opted for more challenging classes, instead of sticking with classes I know are a guaranteed A. I do this because I want to test my limits, see where my abilities will actually take me. I feel that certain risks need to be taken to find out one's true potential, otherwise the aftermath is always littered with regret.</p>
		<p>Kids often mention wanting to be firefighters or policemen at a young age, but often swap out these options for the safer architect or teacher. I would never express any explicit interest in a particular field when I was young, So most of my life I would go along with what my parents thought best: a career path that's safe, yet still lucrative. Examples would include a doctor, engineer, or lawyer. All of these jobs have the reputation of a good, respectable profession. You hear the name and automatically think, "wow, good for them." Yet, if you don't actually enjoy your job, there's no point in finding it "safe" or not, because there will be no validation in what you are doing. I finally rejected my parents' suggestions at 16 years old; I told them there is no way I'd become a doctor after taking AP Biology and finding no interest in the subject. Instead, I chose finance. At first, my parents found it risky: what jobs are there? Do they make money? Is there even demand in the field? They found my decision dangerous, mainly because of their lack of knowledge about the field. Just because of their unawareness of the financial sector, they dismissed the idea as being "too out there." Slowly, I've been able to bring them back to my side by informing them of the all the options actually out there, the versatility of an Economics degree, and most importantly by showing them that I would be able to live comfortably, their main concern. Just as my parents found an unknown study as out of their comfort zone, most people stay away from the stock market from their inexperience. They equate this simple ignorance as risky, when in reality, there is no such thing. There are horror stories of people losing thousands of dollars in the stock market, but these tales come from those who are not prepared, with incorrect expectations of how to handle shares and what exactly they expect to gain. All such perils are erased by merely studying, educating yourself, before making a choice. When a certain understanding is gained, the leap of faith can be taken. If you do not pursue an opportunity for yourself, how will you know how it will it play out for you? Investing has gotten a bad rep in the past few years, but discipline will take this away. Even if investing may not be in your comfort zone, the only way you could find the truth is if you step out of your limits and take the chance.</p>
